# BMI-CALCULATOR-PROJECT

🌟 Objectives of the Project

To develop a simple C program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) using user-provided height and weight.

To understand and apply basic programming concepts such as input/output, variables, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements.

To classify the user’s BMI into standard weight categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).

To enhance problem-solving skills by converting a real-life health formula into a working C program.

To practice modular program design (optional) by splitting the logic into smaller functions if needed.

To create an interactive and user-friendly console application for health-related calculations.

To strengthen knowledge of decision-making in C using if-else or alternative logic structures.
